This is my little project i developed in a short time.
Its about guessing scrambled words in turkish, i tested with GET /word to ensure if the word is scrambled correctly and with POST /guess you can enter your guess as a plain text.
Starting the server and opening the HTML file will direct you to the simple site i made to enter your guesses and chech if its correct there.
Commit 30-05-2025 Ive changed the file structure of the code to be more readable and be organized.
